# Udacity FEND Arcade Game

This is my submission for the Udacity FEND Arcade Game. 

## How to run

Clone this repo or download the .zip folder on GitHub and then navigate to `arcade-game` and open `index.html` in the browser.

## Instructions for playing

This game is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. You will play as a **princess girl** and have cross to the other side
of town by avoiding the enemy bugs. You can control your character with the following keys on your keyboard:

- `up` To move your character up
- `right` To move your character right
- `down` To move your character down
- `left` To move your character left

When you get to the river, you win! The game will just reset you to your original position. The same goes for if you collide with one of the bugs and die. Oops.
