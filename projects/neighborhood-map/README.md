# Neighborhood Map

Neighborhood Map is a web application that shows you the top places to go in Atlanta, GA! This project was created through the use of the KnockoutJS Framework. The project also leveraged the Foursquare and Google Maps APIs to dynamically load data in the application.
## Usage

In order to run this application, you must do the following.

1. Run the application on a web server
2. Get a Google Maps API key
3. Get a Foursquare API key

If you're not sure how to proceed with the above, I suggest googling around.
