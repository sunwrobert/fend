You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
1. Haven't learned any new skills yet, it's mostly been review
2. Basics of HTML
3. Nothing has been difficult yet.
4. Mostly just review of stuff I've done before, so nothing yet. Also, checking the docs from Mozilla was helpful.
